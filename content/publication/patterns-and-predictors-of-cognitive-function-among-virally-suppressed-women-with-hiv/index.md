abstract: "Cognitive impairment remains frequent and heterogeneous in
  presentation and severity among virally suppressed (VS) women with HIV (WWH).
  We identified cognitive profiles among 929 VS-WWH and 717 HIV-uninfected women
  from 11 Women's Interagency HIV Study sites at their first neuropsychological
  (NP) test battery completion comprised of: Hopkins Verbal Learning
  Test-Revised, Trail Making, Symbol Digit Modalities, Grooved Pegboard, Stroop,
  Letter/Animal Fluency, and Letter-Number Sequencing. Using 17 NP performance
  metrics (T-scores), we used Kohonen self-organizing maps to identify patterns
  of high-dimensional data by mapping participants to similar nodes based on
  T-scores and clustering those nodes. Among VS-WWH, nine clusters were
  identified (entropy = 0.990) with four having average T-scores ≥45 for all
  metrics and thus combined into an “unimpaired” profile (n = 311). Impaired
  profiles consisted of weaknesses in: (1) sequencing (Profile-1; n = 129), (2)
  speed (Profile-2; n = 144), (3) learning + recognition (Profile-3; n = 137),
  (4) learning + memory (Profile-4; n = 86), and (5) learning + processing speed
  + attention + executive function (Profile-5; n = 122). Sociodemographic,
  behavioral, and clinical variables differentiated profile membership using
  Random Forest models. The top 10 variables distinguishing the combined
  impaired vs. unimpaired profiles were: clinic site, age, education, race,
  illicit substance use, current and nadir CD4 count, duration of effective
  antiretrovirals, and protease inhibitor use. Additional variables
  differentiating each impaired from unimpaired profile included: depression,
  stress-symptoms, income (Profile-1); depression, employment (Profile 2);
  depression, integrase inhibitor (INSTI) use (Profile-3); employment, INSTI
  use, income, atazanavir use, non-ART medications with anticholinergic
  properties (Profile-4); and marijuana use (Profile-5). Findings highlight
  consideration of NP profile heterogeneity and potential modifiable factors
  contributing to impaired profiles."
