abstract: "The ability to generate human-induced pluripotent stem cell
  (hiPSC)-derived neural cells displaying region-specific phenotypes is of
  particular interest for modeling central nervous system biology in vitro. We
  describe a unique method by which spinal cord hiPSC-derived astrocytes
  (hiPSC-A) are cultured with spinal cord hiPSC-derived motor neurons (hiPSC-MN)
  in a multielectrode array (MEA) system to record electrophysiological activity
  over time. We show that hiPSC-A enhance hiPSC-MN electrophysiological
  maturation in a time-dependent fashion. The sequence of plating, density, and
  age in which hiPSC-A are cocultured with MN, but not their respective hiPSC
  line origin, are factors that influence neuronal electrophysiology. When
  compared to coculture with mouse primary spinal cord astrocytes, we observe an
  earlier and more robust electrophysiological maturation in the fully human
  cultures, suggesting that the human origin is relevant to the recapitulation
  of astrocyte/motor neuron crosstalk. Finally, we test pharmacological
  compounds on our MEA platform and observe changes in electrophysiological
  activity, which confirm hiPSC-MN maturation. These findings are supported by
  immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR studies in parallel cultures
  demonstrating human astrocyte mediated changes in the structural maturation
  and protein expression profiles of the neurons. Interestingly, this
  relationship is reciprocal and coculture with neurons influences astrocyte
  maturation as well. Taken together, these data indicate that in a human in
  vitro spinal cord culture system, astrocytes support hiPSC-MN maturation in a
  time-dependent and species-specific manner and suggest a closer approximation
  of in vivo conditions. "

summary: This study develops a method by which human-induced pluripotent stem
  cell-derived astrocytes (hiPSC-A) with distinct spinal cord identity are
  cocultured with spinal cord motor neurons (hiPSC-MN) for multielectrode array
  (MEA) recordings. It also demonstrates that hiPSC-A influence the
  morphological, molecular, and electrophysiological maturation of hiPSC-MN.
  Similarly, this study shows that hiPSC-A maturation is enhanced by the
  coculture with hiPSC-MN. This fully human, spinal cord-specific, coculture
  platform with MEA analyses provides a new tool for investigating astrocyte/MN
  interactions and has the potential to more accurately model human diseases
  with spinal cord pathology, including spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis.
