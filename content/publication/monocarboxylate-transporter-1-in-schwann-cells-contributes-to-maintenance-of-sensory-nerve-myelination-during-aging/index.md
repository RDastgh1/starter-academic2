abstract: Schwann cell (SC)-specific monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)
  knockout mice were generated by mating MCT1 f/f mice with myelin protein zero
  (P0)-Cre mice. P0-Cre+/−, MCT1 f/f mice have no detectable early developmental
  defects, but develop hypomyelination and reduced conduction velocity in
  sensory, but not motor, peripheral nerves during maturation and aging.
  Furthermore, reduced mechanical sensitivity is evident in aged P0-Cre+/−, MCT1
  f/f mice. MCT1 deletion in SCs impairs both their glycolytic and mitochondrial
  functions, leading to altered lipid metabolism of triacylglycerides,
  diacylglycerides, and sphingomyelin, decreased expression of myelin-associated
  glycoprotein, and increased expression of c-Jun and p75-neurotrophin receptor,
  suggesting a regression of SCs to a less mature developmental state. Taken
  together, our results define the contribution of SC MCT1 to both SC metabolism
  and peripheral nerve maturation and aging.
