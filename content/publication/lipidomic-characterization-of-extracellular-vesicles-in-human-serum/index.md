abstract: There is a wide variety of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that differ in
  size and cargo composition. EVs isolated from human plasma or serum carry
  lipid, protein, and RNA cargo that provides insights to the regulation of
  normal physiological processes, and to pathological states. Specific
  populations of EVs have been proposed to contain protein and RNA cargo that
  are biomarkers for neurologic and systemic diseases. Although there is a
  considerable amount of evidence that circulating lipids are biomarkers for
  multiple disease states, it not clear if these lipid biomarkers are enriched
  in EVs, or if specific populations of EVs are enriched for particular classes
  of lipid. A highly reproducible workflow for the analysis of lipid content in
  EVs isolated from human plasma or serum would facilitate this area of
  research. Here we optimized an MS/MSALL workflow for the untargeted analysis
  of the lipid content in EVs isolated from human serum. A simple sequential
  ultracentrifugation protocol isolated three distinct types of serum EVs that
  were identified based on size, targeted protein, and untargeted lipidomic
  analyses. EVs in the upper and middle fractions were approximately 140 nm in
  diameter, while EVs in the pellet were approximately 110 nm in diameter. EVs
  in the upper most buoyant fractions contained the highest concentration of
  lipids, were enriched with phospholipids, and immunopositive for the
  cytoskeletal markers actin, Î±-actinin, and the mitochondrial protein
  mitofillin, but negative for the typical EV markers CD63, TSG101, and
  flotillin. A central fraction of EVs was devoid of cytoskeletal and
  mitochondrial markers, and positive for CD63, and TSG101, but negative for
  flotillin. The EV pellet contained no cytoskeletal or mitochondrial markers,
  but was positive for CD63, TSG101, and flotillin. The EV pellet contained the
  lowest concentration of most lipids, but was enriched with ceramide. These
  results provided new insights into the lipid composition of EVs isolated from
  serum using a simple ultracentrifugation isolation method suitable for
  lipidomic analysis by mass spectrometry.
