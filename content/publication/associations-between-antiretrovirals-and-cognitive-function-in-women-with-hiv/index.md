abstract: "Cognitive complications persist in antiretroviral
  therapy(ART)-treated people with HIV. However, the pattern and severity of
  domain- specific cognitive performance is variable and may be exacerbated by
  ART-mediated neurotoxicity. 929 women with HIV(WWH) from the Women’s
  Interagency HIV Study who were classified into subgroups based on
  sociodemographic and longitudinal behavioral and clinical data using
  semi-parametric latent class trajectory modelling. Five subgroups were
  comprised of: 1) well-controlled HIV with vascular comorbidities(n = 116); 2)
  profound HIV legacy effects(CD4 nadir <250 cells/μL; n = 275); 3) primarily
  <45 year olds with hepatitis C(n = 165); 4) primarily 35–55 year olds(n =
  244), and 5) poorly-controlled HIV/substance use(n = 129). Within each
  subgroup, we fitted a constrained continuation ratio model via penalized
  maximum likelihood to examine adjusted associations between recent ART agents
  and cognition. Most drugs were not associated with cognition. However, among
  the few drugs, non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTIs) and
  protease inhibitors(PIs) were most commonly associated with cognition,
  followed by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors(NRTIs) and integrase
  inhibitors(IIs). Directionality of ART-cognition associa- tions varied by
  subgroup. Better psychomotor speed and fluency were associated with ART for
  women with well-controlled HIV with vascular comorbidities. This pattern
  contrasts women with profound HIV legacy effects for whom poorer executive
  function and fluency were associated with ART. Motor function was associated
  with ART for younger WWH and primarily 35–55 year olds. Memory was associated
  with ART only for women with poorly-controlled HIV/substance abuse. Findings
  demonstrate interindividual variability in ART-cognition associations among
  WWH and highlight the importance of considering sociodemographic, clinical,
  and behavioral factors as an underlying contributors to cognition. "
