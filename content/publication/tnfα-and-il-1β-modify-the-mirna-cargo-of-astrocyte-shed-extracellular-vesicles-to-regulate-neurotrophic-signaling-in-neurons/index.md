abstract: Astrocytes are known to be critical regulators of neuronal function.
  However, relatively few mediators of astrocyte to neuron communication have
  been identified. Recent advancements in the biology of extracellular vesicles
  have begun to implicate astrocyte derived extracellular vesicles (ADEV) as
  mediators of astrocyte to neuron communication, suggesting that alterations in
  the release and/or composition of ADEVs could influence gliotransmission. TNFα
  and IL-1β are key mediators of glial activation and neuronal damage, but the
  effects of these cytokines on the release or molecular composition of ADEVs is
  unknown. We found that ADEVs released in response to IL-1β (ADEV-IL-1β) and
  TNFα (ADEV-TNFα) were enriched with miRNAs that target proteins involved in
  neurotrophin signaling. We confirmed that miR-125a-5p and miR-16-5p (both
  enriched in ADEV-IL-1β and ADEV-TNFα) targeted NTKR3 and its downstream
  effector Bcl2. Downregulation of these targets in neurons was associated with
  reductions in dendritic growth, dendritic complexity, reduced spike rates, and
  burst activity. Molecular interference of miR-125a-5p and miR-16-5p prevented
  ADEV-IL-1β from reducing dendritic complexity, spike, and burst rates. These
  findings suggest that astrocytes respond to inflammatory challenge by
  modifying the miRNA cargo of ADEVs to diminish the activity of target neurons
  by regulating the translational expression of proteins controlling programs
  essential for synaptic stability and neuronal excitability.
