abstract: Despite advancements in antiretroviral therapy, mild cognitive
  deficits persist in nearly half of people with HIV (PWH). The profile of
  impairment in HIV is highly variable with deficits observed in a range of
  cognitive domains. Despite evidence of greater cognitive impairment among
  women with HIV (WWH) vs. men with HIV (MWH), it is unclear how MWH and WWH
  differ in the type of cognitive impairment and in risk factors associated with
  cognitive impairment profiles. In a large and well-characterized sample of
  PWH, we used machine learning to identify profiles of cognitive functioning
  and their associated factors overall and within sex. Participants included
  1,666 PWH (201 WWH; 1,465 MMH) from the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program
  who completed a neuropsychological test battery at their baseline visits.
  Using demographically-adjusted T-scores from 13 test outcomes assessing motor
  skills, executive functioning, attention/working memory, episodic learning and
  memory, verbal fluency, and processing speed, we used Kohonen self-organizing
  maps to identify patterns of high-dimensional data by mapping participants to
  similar nodes based on T-scores (MCLUST R package). Random forest models were
  used to determine how sociodemographic (e.g., age, education), clinical (e.g.,
  depressive symptoms, substance use disorder), and biological (e.g., HIV
  disease characteristics) factors differentially related to membership within a
  cognitive profile. All analyses were repeated within sex. Three cognitive
  profiles were identified overall and within each sex. Overall and within MWH,
  there were unimpaired and global weakness profiles. The third profile in the
  total sample demonstrated relatively weak auditory attention whereas in MWH
  showed relative strengths in attention and processing speed. Conversely, there
  was no unimpaired profile among WWH. Rather, WWH demonstrated separate
  profiles reflecting weakness in motor skills, a relative weakness in learning
  and delayed recall, and global weaknesses with spared recognition memory.
  Despite different cognitive profiles by sex, the most discriminative factors
  were similar between men and women and included reading level (cognitive
  reserve), current and nadir CD4 count, plasma HIV viral load, duration of HIV
  disease, age, depressive symptoms, and race/ethnicity. Findings fill a
  knowledge gap concerning sex differences in cognitive impairment in PWH and
  inform personalized risk reduction and therapeutic strategies.
