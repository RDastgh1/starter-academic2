abstract: Immunologic function is an important determinant of cognition. Here we
  examined the contribution of early immune signatures to cognitive performance
  among HIV-infected, virally suppressed women (HIV+VS) and in HIV-uninfected
  (HIV-) women. Specifically, we measured serum inflammatory markers, developed
  combinatory immune signatures, and evaluated their associations with
  cognition. Forty-nine HIV+VS women in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS)
  who achieved viral suppression shortly after effective antiretroviral therapy
  (ART) initiation, and 56 matched HIV− women were selected. Forty-two serum
  inflammatory markers were measured within 2 years of effective ART initiation
  for HIV+VS women, and at an initial timepoint for HIV− women. The same
  inflammatory markers were also measured approximately 1, 7, and 12 years later
  for all women. Of the 105 women with complete immune data, 83 (34 HIV+VS, 49
  HIV−) also had cognitive data available 12 years later at ≥1 time points
  (median = 3.1). We searched for combinatory immune signatures by adapting a
  dynamic matrix factorization analytic method that builds upon Tucker
  decomposition followed by Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis to facilitate data
  interpretation. Seven combinatory immune signatures emerged based on the
  Frobenius residual. Three signatures were common between HIV+VS and HIV−
  women, while four signatures were unique. These inflammatory signatures
  predicted subsequent cognitive performance in both groups using mixed-effects
  modeling, but more domain-specific associations were significant in HIV+VS
  than HIV− women. Leukocyte influx into brain was a major contributor to
  cognitive function in HIV+VS women, while T cell exhaustion, inflammatory
  response indicative of depressive/psychiatric disorders, microglial activity,
  and cytokine signaling predicted both global and domain-specific performance
  for HIV− women. Our findings suggest that immune signatures may be useful
  diagnostic, prognostic, and immunotherapeutic targets predictive of subsequent
  cognitive performance. Importantly, they also provide insight into common and
  distinct inflammatory mechanisms underlying cognition in HIV− and HIV+VS
  women.
