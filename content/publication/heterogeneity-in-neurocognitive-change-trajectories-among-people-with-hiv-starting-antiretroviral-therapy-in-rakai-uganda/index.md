abstract: "Considerable heterogeneity exists in patterns of neurocognitive
  change in people with HIV (PWH). We examined heterogeneity in neurocognitive
  change trajectories from HIV diagnosis to 1–2 years post-antiretroviral
  therapy (ART). In an observational cohort study in Rakai, Uganda, 312 PWH
  completed a neuropsychological (NP) test battery at two-time points
  (ART-naïve, 1–2 years post-ART initiation). All NP outcomes were used in a
  latent profile analysis to identify subgroups of PWH with similar ART-related
  neurocognitive change profiles. In a subset, we examined subgroup differences
  pre-ART on cytokine and neurodegenerative biomarkers CSF levels. We identified
  four ART-related change subgroups: (1) decline-only (learning, memory,
  fluency, processing speed, and attention measures), (2) mixed (improvements in
  learning and memory but declines in attention and executive function
  measures), (3) no-change, or (4) improvement-only (learning, memory, and
  attention measures). ART-related NP outcomes that are most likely to change
  included learning, memory, and attention. Motor function measures were
  unchanged. Subgroups differed on eight of 34 pre-ART biomarker levels
  including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-13, interferon-γ, macrophage
  inflammatory protein-1β, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, MMP-10, and
  platelet-derived growth factor-AA. The improvement-only and mixed subgroups
  showed lower levels on these markers versus the no-change subgroup. These
  findings provide support for the need to disentangle heterogeneity in
  ART-related neurocognitive changes, to focus on higher-order cognitive
  processes (learning, memory, attention) as they were most malleable to change,
  and to better understand why motor function remained unchanged despite ART
  treatment. Group differences in pre-ART CSF levels provide preliminary
  evidence of biological plausibility of neurocognitive phenotyping."
