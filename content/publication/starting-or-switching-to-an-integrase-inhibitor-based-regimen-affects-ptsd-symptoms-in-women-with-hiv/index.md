abstract: "As the use of Integrase inhibitor (INSTI)-class antiretroviral
  medications becomes more common to maintain long-term viral suppression, early
  reports suggest the potential for CNS side-effects when starting or switching
  to an INSTI-based regimen. In a population already at higher risk for
  developing mood and anxiety disorders, these drugs may have significant
  effects on PTSD scale symptom scores, particularly in women with HIV (WWH). A
  total of 551 participants were included after completing ≥ 1 WIHS study visits
  before and after starting/switching to an INSTI-based ART regimen. Of these,
  14% were ART naïve, the remainder switched from primarily a protease inhibitor
  (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen.
  Using multivariable linear mixed effects models, we compared PTSD Civilian
  Checklist subscale scores before and after a “start/switch” to dolutegravir
  (DTG), raltegravir (RAL), or elvitegravir (EVG). Start/switch to EVG improved
  re-experiencing subscale symptoms (P’s < 0.05). Switching to EVG improved
  symptoms of avoidance (P = 0.01). Starting RAL improved arousal subscale
  symptoms (P = 0.03); however, switching to RAL worsened re-experiencing
  subscale symptoms (P < 0.005). Starting DTG worsened avoidance subscale
  symptoms (P = 0.03), whereas switching to DTG did not change subscale or
  overall PTSD symptoms (P’s > 0.08). In WWH, an EVG-based ART regimen is
  associated with improved PTSD symptoms, in both treatment naïve patients and
  those switching from other ART. While a RAL-based regimen was associated with
  better PTSD symptoms than in treatment naïve patients, switching onto a
  RAL-based regimen was associated with worse PTSD symptoms. DTG-based regimens
  either did not affect, or worsened symptoms, in both naïve and switch
  patients. Further studies are needed to determine mechanisms underlying
  differential effects of EVG, RAL and DTG on stress symptoms in WWH. "
