abstract: Despite a multitude of commercially available multi-electrode array
  (MEA) systems that are each capable of rapid data acquisition from cultured
  neurons or slice cultures, there is a general lack of available analysis
  tools. These analysis gaps restrict the efficient extraction of meaningful
  physiological features from data sets, and limit interpretation of how
  experimental manipulations modify neural network activity. Here, we present
  the development of a user-friendly, publicly-available software called
  MEAnalyzer. This software contains several spike train analysis methods
  including relevant statistical calculations, periodicity analysis, functional
  connectivity analysis, and advanced data visualizations in a user-friendly
  graphical user interface that requires no coding from the user. Widespread
  availability of this user friendly and mathematically advanced program will
  stimulate and enhance the use of MEA technologies.
