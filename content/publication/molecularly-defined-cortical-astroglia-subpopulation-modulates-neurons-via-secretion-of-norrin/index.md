abstract: Despite expanding knowledge regarding the role of astroglia in
  regulating neuronal function, little is known about regional or functional
  subgroups of brain astroglia and how they may interact with neurons. We use an
  astroglia-specific promoter fragment in transgenic mice to identify an
  anatomically defined subset of adult gray matter astroglia. Using
  transcriptomic and histological analyses, we generate a combinatorial profile
  for the in vivo identification and characterization of this astroglia
  subpopulation. These astroglia are enriched in mouse cortical layer V; express
  distinct molecular markers, including Norrin and leucine-rich
  repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), with corresponding
  layer-specific neuronal ligands; are found in the human cortex; and modulate
  neuronal activity. Astrocytic Norrin appears to regulate dendrites and spines;
  its loss, as occurring in Norrie disease, contributes to cortical dendritic
  spine loss. These studies provide evidence that human and rodent astroglia
  subtypes are regionally and functionally distinct, can regulate local neuronal
  dendrite and synaptic spine development, and contribute to disease.
