I am an Instructor of Neurology at the Johns Hopkins Brain Health Group.  I have a background in engineering and computer science, and I currently apply tools from those fields to addressing questions related to brain health - ranging from the bench to the clinic. 

Modern technology gives us more data than most people know what to do with.  Bench scientists should not be limited in terms of what they can analyze due to a lack of coding ability.  Coming from that world, I enjoy creating encapsulated GUIs to help analyze all sorts of data. 

Even in the computational world, I believe that all the tenants of good science still hold.  Our "experiments" must be reproducible. And generating hypothesis from observations -- that gives us so much opportunity for using Data Visualization to look at all of our data from so many different angles to generate those hypothesis. 

I also use Machine Learning models as hypothesis-generating models. Usually focusing on Variable Importance metrics from validated models, I work on visualizations to help interpret and explore them contextually
